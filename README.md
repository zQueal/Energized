# Energized Protection Lists

This repository is a stopgap for when Energized services are down. The Magisk module currenlty doesn't fetch lists because the webservices are offline for the moment.

These are the raw lists, no extensions. Choose which you'd like to use, and use AdAway or another systemless hosts file manager to add the generated hosts file.

I won't be building these every day...
